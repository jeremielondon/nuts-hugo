There isn’t much London can’t offer for a good night out in town. With so many comedy clubs, exclusive music venues and late night bars, choosing where to go for a good night in London can be more than a little mind boggling. So before you put on your dancing shoes, remember your e111 card renewal, ID, cash and card! It doesn’t matter whether you are on a budget and want to save on the pennies, or simply want to visit some of the best bars London has to offer on a Thursday night – because after all, Thursday is the new Friday – here’s where to go for a guaranteed cocktail-filled night in London:


### Icebar London

If you’re looking to do something a little different, why not go to Icebar London? Not only is it literally the coolest (and most unique) bar in London, serving cocktails in -5 C temperatures all year-round in glasses made of ice, but the entire bar is shaped from crystal-clear artic river ice too. If sitting in below freezing temperatures makes you shiver at the thought, don’t fret! When you arrive, you will be handed a designer thermal cape and gloves to keep you snug throughout your designated 40-minute session.

### Tape London
If you thrive listening to live music and the latest DJ sets, you definitely need to head to Tape London! Located in Mayfair, Tape London is an exclusive nightclub offering a stylish party experience for a thrill-seeking crowd. For a night full of great music and good vibes, apply for guest list or book a table to join other elite clubbers for a chic night out! But, in order to gain entry be sure to dress to impress!

### Electric Brixton
Since September 2011, Electric Brixton has been hosting a series of regular electronic, house and dance nights, such as LoveJuice, as well as inviting big-name DJs including Sammy Porter, and live acts to join the on-going party. Following a multi-million pound investment, Electric Brixton is available for private hire so you can host the ultimate party for all your friends.

### Fabric
You can’t go to London and not experience one of the city’s most famous clubbing attractions – Fabric. Fabric is yet another legendary London nightclub, featuring three rooms for three times the fun! As well as hosting some of the world’s biggest DJs, including the likes of Dave Angel, Carl Cox and Jamie Jones, Fabric is famous for its cutting-edge house, techno, electro and disco vibes.

### Ministry Of Sound
The Ministry of Sound has, and will continue to, entertain Londoners and tourists for years. Having hosted some of the best nights out in London for more than 20 years, it’s no wonder that Ministry of Sound is one of the most popular clubs to drink and dance the night away in London. With four dancefloors and five rooms in total, you’ll surely want to book tickets in advance and arrive early to avoid disappointment and long queues!
You can also book the [Ministry Pub Crawl](https://nutspubcrawl.com/the-tours/ministry-of-sound/) that will allow you to visit few clubs before ending at Ministry. You will jump the queue and the entry fee is included.

### London Pub Crawl
-	To party in different clubs in one night, [Nuts Pub Crawl](https://nutspubcrawl.com/ "Nuts Pub Crawl") focused on many trendy/busy bars around Leicester Square and Piccadilly Circus. The idea is to party in 4 clubs during one night. £10 discounted online tickets provide you the entry fees, discounted drinks, free shots.
