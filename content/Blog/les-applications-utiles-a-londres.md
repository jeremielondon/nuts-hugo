<strong>Arriving in the most densely populated capital of Europe, you have to adapt, so we’ve put together a top list of essential apps to have to hand when settling in London.</strong>

## Find your way Apps
<li><strong><a href="https://citymapper.com/london">CityMapper:</a></strong> To know where you are going, you could use the GPS already installed on your phone, but when you start to use it, you will understand. For all your journeys, the app calculates the optimal route for you, depending on your preferences. If you prefer to travel only by bus, underground, or even by Uber (the app gives you the fare). The app is updated throughout the day, so you are notified if there is a problem on your transport line, if there are delays etc. Finally, an option even allows you to choose the route that will be most sheltered in bad weather. The app is very user-friendly, easy to handle and practical. To use it is to adopt it.</li>
