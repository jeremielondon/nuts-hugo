Like most expatriates, you are looking for a job.  We will give you a few tips to help you get started. Before you start looking for a job, you will have to get your <a href="/blog/national-insurance-number/">National Insurance Number</a>. This document does not give you the right to work but insures you in the same way as a British person. Once your NIN is obtained, begin the process of opening <a href="/blog/opening-a-bank-account-in-london/">a bank account.</a>

When you have everything set up, you just have to find where to work. If you are looking to work in order to live in London, you will find a job at restaurants or chains like Pret-a-Manger, Costa Coffee, that do not require much in the way of experience. <a href="/blog/housing-in-london/">Youth hostels or student halls</a> can be a good idea to be housed and paid at the same time.

#### To keep in mind

Legally, the hourly minimum wage is fairly equivalent to the French minimum wage at around £6/hour. For a job as waiting staff, this will be in the region of £7.50/hr. Know that you can not work more than 48 hours per week, or it will be on a voluntary basis.

#### How do I find a job?

<ul><li>Agencies: As with finding a place to live, there are those who will work to find you a job in a shorter timeframe. You can update your CV in English and prepare for the future interviews that they will offer you. The services depend on the agencies, some offer to find you a job and housing like the <a href="http://www.centrecharlespeguy.com/">centre charle peguy</a>, <a href="http://www.londonworkfr.com/">LondonWork</a>, <a href="http://london.eazycity.com/">London eazycity</a> and others...</li></ul>

<ul><li>Door to door: Submit your CV directly to the desired places, if you do not have too many requirements or an English that isn’t too developed, be bold and create opportunities. Think of Oscar Wilde, “Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss you’ll land among the stars”. If you want to join a large chain like <a href="https://www.starbucks.co.uk/careers/working-at-starbucks">Starbucks</a>, <a href="https://pret.csod.com/ats/careersite/search.aspx?site=1&amp;c=pret">Pret-a-Manger</a>, <a href="http://www.costacareers.co.uk/">Costa</a> and other <a href="https://people.mcdonalds.co.uk/restaurant-opportunities/crew-member/">McDonalds</a>, go to their sites, this will avoid throwing your paper in the bin.</li><li>

</li></ul><ul><li>Apps: Apps such as <a href="https://syftapp.com/">Syft</a> or <a href="https://www.coople.com/uk/en/">Coople</a> allow you to apply for many job offers easily, whether for short term or long term assignments.</li></ul>

<ul><li>Social networks: Keep an eye on them, as with the Facebook groups such as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/LECERCLEDESFRANCAISALONDRES/">The French circle in London</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/soireelondoncalling/">London Calling</a>. Very often posts are made available to you, and they go very quickly.</li></ul>Caution: with these tips you may find work quickly, before you get hired, take advantage of the city.
