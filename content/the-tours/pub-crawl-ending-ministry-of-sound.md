visit 2 great bars in shiny, central London, with free entry, free shots & drinks deals, a photographer and some awesome Hosts. Then head together over to Ministry of Sound Nightclub – one of London’s biggest and most famous – where you slide on in with free entry, worth £20+ alone! (No drinks deals or free shots in Ministry of Sound)<br><br>

Start off in Soho’s Dirty Harry’s (with their dirty dancers kicking off at 9pm!) and then hit one more great venue to mingle and get in the cheap drinks. Then take a tube to Ministry of Sound (Elephant & Castle) where the party keeps going until 6am!

<br><br>
*Please note: 18+ only. Valid, physical ID compulsory. You are required to pay your tube fair (£2.40 using contactless/oyster).
<br><br>

There are limited tickets, so book early, save a fortune, and get ready for an amazing night!
